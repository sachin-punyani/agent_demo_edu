# Virtual Marketing Assistant

This is a Streamlit application that serves as a virtual marketing assistant, allowing users to enter queries and receive responses from an Amazon Bedrock agent.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the necessary packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

To run the Streamlit application, use the following command:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the application, and you can access it through your web browser.

Once the application is running, you will see a user interface where you can enter your queries. Type your question or request into the input field and press Enter or click the "Submit" button. The virtual marketing assistant, powered by an Amazon Bedrock agent, will process your query and provide a response.

## Codebase Structure

The codebase consists of the following files:

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file that defines the user interface and handles user interactions.
- `InvokeAgent.py`: A module that contains functions for invoking the Amazon Bedrock agent and processing the responses.
- `requirements.txt`: A file specifying the required Python dependencies for the project.
